Of course! Here is a README.md file that explains the provided Python code, detailing its functionality and architecture.

LangGraph Conversational Agent with Tools
This project demonstrates how to build a simple, powerful conversational agent using LangChain and LangGraph. The agent can answer general questions and use custom tools to fetch specific, real-time data, like stock prices.

üöÄ How It Works
The core of this application is a state machine or a graph that manages the flow of conversation. The agent decides whether to answer a question directly or to use a tool based on the user's query.

Here‚Äôs the step-by-step workflow:

1. State Management
The conversation's memory is managed by a State object. In this code, it's a simple dictionary that holds one key: messages.

Python

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
TypedDict: This ensures our state object has a well-defined structure.

messages: A list that stores the entire conversation history (user queries and AI responses).

Annotated[list, add_messages]: This is a special LangGraph helper. Instead of overwriting the messages with each new turn, it appends them to the list, maintaining the context of the conversation.

2. Tool Definition
We equip our agent with a custom tool to fetch stock prices.

Python

@tool
def get_stock_price(symbol: str) -> float:
    '''Return the current price of a stock given the stock symbol'''
    # ... implementation ...
The @tool decorator from LangChain automatically makes this Python function available to the language model.

The function's docstring is crucial! The model uses the description ('Return the current price of a stock...') to understand what the tool does and when to use it.

3. Graph Construction üèóÔ∏è
We use StateGraph to define the agent's logic as a series of nodes and edges.

Nodes (The Steps)
chatbot Node: This node represents the "brain" of our agent. It takes the current conversation state and invokes the Language Model (LLM). The LLM is "bound" to our tools, meaning it knows they exist and can decide to call them.

tools Node: This is a special ToolNode. If the chatbot node decides to use a tool, this node is responsible for actually executing the tool function (e.g., get_stock_price('AAPL')) and returning the result.

Edges (The Connections)
START ‚Üí chatbot: Every conversation starts at the chatbot node.

chatbot ‚Üí tools OR END (Conditional Edge): This is the most critical part. After the chatbot node runs:

If the LLM's response includes a request to call a tool (like get_stock_price), the graph follows the edge to the tools node.

If the LLM's response is a final answer to the user, the graph follows the edge to the END state, and the turn is over.

The built-in tools_condition function handles this routing logic automatically.

tools ‚Üí chatbot: After the tools node executes the function, the result (e.g., the stock price) is passed back to the chatbot node. The LLM now sees the tool's output and uses this new information to generate a final, human-readable answer.
